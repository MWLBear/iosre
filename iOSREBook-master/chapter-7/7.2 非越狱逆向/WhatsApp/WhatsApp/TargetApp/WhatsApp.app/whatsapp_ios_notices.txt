However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success
stories.
 
The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC
Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center
for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the
development of open-source software as part of the open-source software
community. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no
warranties whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability,
noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any
particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,
indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including
without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such
damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any
kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a
particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing,
usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt
University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect
to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC
software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington
University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students
be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect and
consequential damages.
 
DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the
part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their
employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or
enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support
for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the
underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant
with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy
Act of 2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the
United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains
time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be
affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems
accordingly.

Copyright (c) 2011, Vernon Adams (vern@newtypography.co.uk),
with Reserved Font Name Norican.

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT
OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
